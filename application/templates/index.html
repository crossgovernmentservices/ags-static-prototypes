    <p class="panel text">The AGS alpha finished early Feb 2017 and the beta is going out for procurement. This site has been expanded and cleaned up in the hope it'll provide the new team with a useful place to find all the existing design work and thinking.</p>

    <h2 id="theproblem" class="heading-large">The problem</h2>

    <p class="text">Accessing GaaP Services (AGS) attempts to fix the issue of account proliferation whilst also shifting risk and resource effort from service teams to department IT teams, teams already tasks with managing identity. It does this by replacing traditional email and password sign in mechanics with an alternative that defers authentication responsibility to the department and their own individual identity solution.</p>

    <p class="text">During the alpha we want to explore how feasible this is, both from the perspective of the users signing into services as well as testing the suitability of the technology in place.</p>

    <h2 id="designlinks" class="heading-large">Design links</h2>

    <p class="text">A collection of the work design produced during the alpha. Includes plans we had if we were taking this forward into a private beta.</p>

As more departments sign up the list will grow. It may get to the point where a different approach is required.</p>

This needs more testing, it is not the normal place to end a sign out journey.</p>
