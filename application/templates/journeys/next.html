    <h2 id="keychallenge">Key challenge?</h2>
    <p class="text">An aspect we've been keen to explore during the Alpha is how visible should the AGS service be? Sign in processes are bumps in a journey at the best of times so how much information and signposting do the users need for this, potentially, unfamiliar process to be acceptable and at least not any worse?</p>

    <p class="text">This challenge was also raised by the designer on the assessment panel as being the crux of the problem for design.</p>

    <p class="text">Starting from the point of designing as little as possible we started the Alpha changing as little as possible and inserting as little as possible. The main change was the introduction of a step for the user to pick their department from a list. It was clear early on more support and context would be needed. We've gradually introduced more information and steps for the user but I still don't believe we've found the right balance yet.</p>

    <h2 id="todo">Things to do / experiment with</h2>

    <ul class="text">
      <li>Remove the auto redirect aspect of interstitial pages.<p class="description-text">No need for this, users should be able to read content at own pace and then click continue.</p></li>
      <li>Change icons on interstitial pages. <p class="description-text">Currently too similar to Verify, need to move away from that.</p></li>
      <li>Implement search on the full list of IdPs. <p class="description-text">Users should be able to filter the list by searching using identifiers for their place of work.</p><p class="description-text">At the moment we believe that after the email they use the department name next. However some users have been confused when asked what department they work for and have instead used the project they work on. Needs further testing.</p></li>
      <li>Capture the minimum requirements for an IdP to integrate with AGS. <p class="description-text">For this to work the IdPs need to implement OIDC correctly. In practice not all IdPs have implemented all of the spec, however some of it is necessary to deliver a good service to the users.</p><p class="description-text">We may need to have a baseline that an IdP needs to meet before integrating with our solution. What are the essentials? What might cause issues with IdPs we want to integrate with, are there work arounds? How do we deliver the message? Could this become a blocker?</p></li>
      <li>Accessibility focus.<p class="description-text">Before we get too far with building the service we need to be sure we are following good accessibility practises and are regularly checking our solutions against accessibility standards.</p><p class="description-text">They are already a few areas we need to check up on e.g. would the icons appearing first on interstitial pages cause any issues for screen magnifiers. Verify have something similar, have they tested it we these types of users?</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="totest">What to test</h2>

    <ul class="text">
      <li>More testing with users not in incognito windows. <p class="description-text">We have mainly tested with users in incognito windows, the reason being that most users already have a tab open with their logged in email and we wanted to test them signing in to a service through the IdP.</p><p class="description-text">It has been helpful to observe users signing in through different IdPs however there needs to be more focus on a more natural journey; when a user is already authenticated so signing in is little more than our service checking they are still authenticated, there is very little for the user to do.</p><p class="description-text">A potential issue (observed with a single user in R5) is the user not building a correct model of what has happened because they have minimal interaction. This can lead to confusion later on.</p></li>
      <li>More testing of the shortened sign back in journey.<p class="description-text">Only tested in R5 with 2 users.</p><p class="description-text">In particular does playing back the reason we chose a given department/IdP make sense? Do they understand how to change it if it is wrong or they are a different user?</p><p class="description-text">Does the continued use of the information/interstitial pages become frustrating?</p></li>
      <li>Observe if the differences in department IdP journeys impacts the overall comfort of the sign in journey.</li>
      <li>Sign in journeys with other GaaP components.</li>
      <li>With users who switch between multiple services (ideally GaaP services).<p class="description-text">What is their experience? Are they regularly halted by signing in journeys? Do they ever get stuck? What would be different with our solution? Is that actually the case?</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="ideas">Ideas</h2>

    <ul class="text">
      <li>Consider testing a "don't show me this again" checkbox on the interstitials/information pages.<p class="description-text">These screens were designed to combat the issue some users experienced when they were not expecting to be taken to a 3rd party site, it resulted in them being conflicted whether to continue.</p><p class="description-text">It is less useful for returning users. The more familiar they become with this method of signing in the less necessary these screens become.</p><p class="description-text">I would consider allowing the user to stop these screens showing. In that case it would be sensible to have an alternative way for the user to see similar content.</p></li>
      <li>Need to test with users who share machines.<p class="description-text">Will this cause issues? What are the potential pitfalls of this? How prevalent is this issue? Does it cause any complications with the technology? Note: Border intelligence staff share machines.</p></li>
      <li>Explore needs of users who have multiple accounts.<p class="description-text">During the alpha we observed that some users had multiple accounts for the same service, sometimes by adding a &#43; symbol to their email. They usually did this for testing or to have a "safe" account.</p><p class="description-text">This would present a problem to our solution in it's current guise.</p><p class="description-text">We need to explore these users more. It would be useful to understand why they do this and whether their needs could be satisfied without the need for them to have multiple accounts or multiple emails for these accounts.</p></li>
      <li>What should the IdP of last resort look like?<p class="description-text">The IdP of last resort is where users who do not, currently, belong to a department IdP need to have an account. It is required so that services using our sign in solution do not need to manage any of their own user creds as well.</p><p class="description-text">It is expected to start out large, whilst departments sort their IdPs out, although it will be important to keep the departments on track by not making it easy for all their users to be part of it.</p><p class="description-text">Once the department IdPs are in place user need to be 'moved' across.</p><p class="description-text">All likelihood there will always be a need for this because their will be small departments or agencies where it does not make sense for them to have their own IdP.</p><p class="description-text">It is essential these users are not blocked from using the services they need to use.</p><p class="description-text">It would make sense to build something that is easy for users to complete their sign in journeys as well as helps us gather evidence and develop patterns for how departments should set up their IdPs.</p><p class="description-text">For example, I can imagine patterns about 2FA done well, effective password strategies and operation models (resetting passwords, account suspension, etc).</p></li>
      <li>During the Alpha we mainly focused on users signing in. Worth exploring journeys/services for other user groups.<p class="description-text">We felt the approach we took was a logical first step, if end users couldn’t sign in then it wouldn’t make sense to explore any of the potential services for departments adding their IdPs, for dev teams building services with this or for services for department IT (e.g. for their leavers process).</p><p class="description-text">In particular we could explore what level of “service” a service team would need to adopt this, will documentation alone suffice?</p><p class="description-text">As previously mentioned, what is an MVP of an IdP that can integrate with AGS? Would it be worth capturing what we know at this point and the seeing where the gaps / constraints for departments are?</p><p class="description-text">Would department IT need a service for the leavers process?</p></li>
      <li>Another area not explored in depth is the various security needs a service may have. <p class="description-text">Are there situations where a service has or needs a shorter session timeout than the IdP session (e.g. google is 30 days)? If so what needs to happen here, would just checking with the IdP that the user is still authenticated suffice? Or would the service require the user to reauthenticate?</p><p class="description-text">Is reauthentication possible, it is suppose to be according to the OIDC spec but IdPs don't always have it enabled. What would the journey be if that was the case? Would the service force the user to be signed out of their email/IdP so that they need to reauth?</p><p class="description-text">Again is that something a service / broker or gateway can request? If it can't then what? If it can does that cause risks that a service might keep logging a user out of their IdP?</p><p class="description-text">Can the auth via an IdP model be used for individual transactions, such as, high value transactions? Could a well placed reauth journey make a service more secure?</p></li>
